# BlackOut-IO-2.0-UI
WPF Userinterface created for https://twitter.com/BlackOutIO last spring. Ended up not using it as I quit the project. It's mostly complete, with some sensitive stuff removed. There may be some bugs &amp; the code isn't the cleanest. 


Includes : Save / Edit / Del Tasks, Profiles, Settings, Proxylists, ecc

Some stuff is yet to be done, but I ceased development. Feel free to use for your personal needs, do not use for commcercial purposes.


How to use:
- Open project map
- Install dependencies that you need
- f5
